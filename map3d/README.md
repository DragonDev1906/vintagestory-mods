# Map 3D
## Roadmap
- [ ] More restrictions on Copper and Bronze (e.g. only a single chunk and no LOD)
- [ ] Handheld (Item) for placing a fixed-size temporary map.
- [ ] Keep data and settings when block is broken
- [ ] Replace model for the projector variant
- [ ] Allow upgrading a placed block via World Interaction
- [ ] Maybe: Further restrict the block type to the area it was first placed in (unsure if I want that)

## Known Issues
- Size and exact positions are not accurate, yet.
- Maps are only loaded on first interaction
- First interaction takes 2 clicks for the GI to show up
